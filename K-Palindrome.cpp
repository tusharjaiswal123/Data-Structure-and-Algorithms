PROBLEM:

A string is k palindrome if it can be transformed into a palindrome on removing at most k characters from it. Your task is to complete
the function is_k_palin which takes two arguments a string str and a number N . Your function should return true if the string is k
palindrome else it should return false.

Input:
The first line of input is an integer T denoting the number of test cases . Then T test cases follow . Each test case  contains a
string str and an integer N separated by space.  

Output:
The output will be 1 if the string is  k palindrome else 0 .

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=length of str<=100
1<=N<=20

Example:
Input
2
abcdecba 1
acdcb  1
Output
1
0
